NOTE THAT THE start_wwcservices.sh AND kill_wwcservices.sh  SCRIPTS IN THIS FOLDER WORK ONLY IF YOU ARE USING THE OSL SERVER: osl-server1.cs.illinois.edu
IT WOULD NEED MODIFICATIONS IF YOU USE A DIFFERENT MACHINE FOR NAMESERVER AND SALSA THEATERS ON LAPTOP SIDE

To run Face detection application: 
1) Log in to OSL server
2) Checkout this folder on the OSL server
3) Run "sh start_wwcservices.sh" to start the nameserver
4) Change the mobile IP address at this line: https://github.com/athuls/android_monitor/blob/6d426c475b4dcb92a487fc64b5f0060de229ba0c/salsa/AndroidTheaterStudio/app/src/main/java/com/example/androidtheater5/MainActivity.java#L66 
4) Deploy the app on phone via Android Studio to get the logs
5) You can change time period for Face detector (depending on time that each runtakes) at this link: https://github.com/athuls/android_monitor/blob/6d426c475b4dcb92a487fc64b5f0060de229ba0c/salsa/AndroidTheaterStudio/app/src/main/java/com/example/androidtheater5/MainActivity.java#L121

To verify app is running correctly: 
- You should messages that look similar to the following on the phone app display: 
  "Reporter:: uan://osl-server1.cs.illinois.edu:3030/LocalFaceDetector0 --> finished processing <img_08.jpg> in time: 115 with number of faces detected being: 5"
  "Reporter:: PHONE_APP: Phone App. Manager Finished."
  "Exp_Starter:: Total Phone_app runtime is: 135"
  "Exp_Starter:: Phone_App_Manager has finished with the resulf of: SUCCESS"

- Also, look specifically for the SUCCESS message above
