NOTE THAT THE start_wwcservices.sh AND kill_wwcservices.sh  SCRIPTS IN THIS FOLDER WORK ONLY IF YOU ARE USING THE OSL SERVER: osl-server1.cs.illinois.edu
IT WOULD NEED MODIFICATIONS IF YOU USE A DIFFERENT MACHINE FOR NAMESERVER AND SALSA THEATERS ON LAPTOP SIDE

To run ExSort application: 
1) Log in to OSL server
2) Checkout this folder on the OSL server
3) Run "sh start_wwcservices.sh" to start the nameserver
   Note that you can restart all the services by running "sh kill_wwcservices.sh" and then running the start script again. 
4) Change the mobile IP address at this line: (https://github.com/athuls/android_monitor/blob/fcddb6a45c9b71d937d1434229840a6c2d89251b/salsa/AndroidTheaterStudio/app/src/main/java/com/example/androidtheater5/MainActivity.java#L75)
4) Deploy the app on phone via Android Studio to get the logs
5) You can change time period for ExSort (depending on time that ExSort takes) at this link:https://github.com/athuls/android_monitor/blob/fcddb6a45c9b71d937d1434229840a6c2d89251b/salsa/AndroidTheaterStudio/app/src/main/java/com/example/androidtheater5/MainActivity.java#L129 

To verify app is running correctly: 
- You should messages that look similar to the following on the phone app display: 
  "PHONE_APP: Phone App. Manager Finished."
  "Exp_Starter:: Total Phone_app runtime is: 1762"
  "Exp_Starter:: Phone_App_Manager has finished with the result of: SUCCESS"
- Also, if you look at FileExplorer while running the app, you will see a directory called "output" created at root/sdcard. And there will be 2 files that are continuously being updated with content. The size of the files changes from 0-2 MB. Note that the app is constantly reading these files on 2 different actor instances and writing back content to them.
