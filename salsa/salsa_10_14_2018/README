NOTE THAT THE start_wwcservices.sh AND kill_wwcservices.sh  SCRIPTS IN THIS FOLDER WORK ONLY IF YOU ARE USING THE OSL SERVER: osl-server1.cs.illinois.edu
IT WOULD NEED MODIFICATIONS IF YOU USE A DIFFERENT MACHINE FOR NAMESERVER AND SALSA THEATERS ON LAPTOP SIDE

To run Nqueens + Exsort + Ping application: 
1) Log in to OSL server
2) Checkout this folder on the OSL server
3) Run "sh start_wwcservices.sh" to start the nameserver
   Note that you can restart all the services by running "sh kill_wwcservices.sh" and then running the start script again.

4) Deploy the app on phone via Android Studio to get the logs
5) You can also change time period for Nqueens, Exsort and Ping applications at these lines:
   - https://github.com/athuls/android_monitor/blob/6ce5471a78a2ffe1f96c78ebf8311ae7bf78e573/salsa/AndroidTheaterStudio/app/src/main/java/com/example/androidtheater5/MainActivity.java#L176

To verify app is running correctly: 
- You should messages that look similar to the following on the phone app display: 
  "73712"

  "PHONE_APP: Phone App. Manager Finished."
  "Exp_Starter:: Total Phone_app runtime is: 1762"
  "Exp_Starter:: Phone_App_Manager has finished with the result of: SUCCESS"

  "Received ECHO within 5157 ms. with message..."
  "Message sending avg time: 88 ms."

- Also, if you look at FileExplorer while running the app, you will see a directory called "output" created at root/sdcard. And there will be 2 files that are continuously being updated with content. The size of the files changes from 0-2 MB. Note that the app is constantly reading these files on 2 different actor instances and writing back content to them.
