NOTE THAT THE start_wwcservices.sh AND kill_wwcservices.sh  SCRIPTS IN THIS FOLDER WORK ONLY IF YOU ARE USING THE OSL SERVER: osl-server1.cs.illinois.edu
IT WOULD NEED MODIFICATIONS IF YOU USE A DIFFERENT MACHINE FOR NAMESERVER AND SALSA THEATERS ON LAPTOP SIDE

To run NQueens + Ping application: 
1) Log in to OSL server
2) Checkout this folder on the OSL server
3) Run "sh start_wwcservices.sh" to start the nameserver and EchoAgent on OSL server
4) Change the mobile IP address at this line: (https://github.com/athuls/android_monitor/blob/f16f7f26eb6f1f09775470330591177c98a01f9c/salsa/AndroidTheaterStudio/app/src/main/java/com/example/androidtheater5/MainActivity.java#L76) 
4) Deploy the app on phone via Android Studio to get the logs
5) Depending on the message sending avg time between Ping agent and EchoAgent (you can get this information on phone app display), change the time period at this line: (https://github.com/athuls/android_monitor/blob/f16f7f26eb6f1f09775470330591177c98a01f9c/salsa/AndroidTheaterStudio/app/src/main/java/com/example/androidtheater5/MainActivity.java#L156) 
6) You can also change time period for Nqueens application at this line: https://github.com/athuls/android_monitor/blob/f16f7f26eb6f1f09775470330591177c98a01f9c/salsa/AndroidTheaterStudio/app/src/main/java/com/example/androidtheater5/MainActivity.java#L128

To verify app is running correctly: 
- You should messages that look similar to the following on the phone app display: 
  "73712"
  "Received ECHO within 5157 ms. with message..."
  "Message sending avg time: 88 ms."
