1) Linear regression: didn't work. We used the actor count and tried to plot it against battery drops (linearly intrapolated). But that didn't work because our actor count samples were instantaneous measurements. We had no idea how many actors ran before and after that moment. Plus the battery drop measurements were very coarse. We had to linearly intrapolate it for each second and that drop couldn't be attributed only to the actor count at the beginning of that second. So we ended up getting a flat plot which essentially suggests random behavior between actor count and battery drops.
2) Is there heteroscedasticity in the data? Need to check.
