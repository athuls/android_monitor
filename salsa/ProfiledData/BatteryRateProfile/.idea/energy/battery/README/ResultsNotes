1) The correlation is strongest when the histogram difference doesn't try to amortize the cost between dominant frequency bins and treats them as the same. So its not the number of actors in a sampled datapoint but the entire histogram in an interval that causes a battery drop to behave the way it does. (Not really sure?)

2) We maintain the top 5 histograms in terms of being expensive energy wise. Now when we see a pattern of execution coming up, we offload that pattern to remote. For this we need to continuously evaluate the pattern and figure incrementally if we are approaching a pattern that is expensive energy wise.
